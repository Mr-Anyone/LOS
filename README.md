# Simple Operating System 

This is a simple operating system that was implemented when I was in high school. To run this code, you would have to setup a cross compiler (i686-elf-gcc) and all of its related tool chains. 

Please keep in mind that I implemented this when I was young, so the code isn't probably that great!
